# HoloWellness Chatbot Implementation Summary

## Professional Doctor System Prompt Implementation

### Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of a professional doctor persona system for the HoloWellness chatbot with strict 4-part response structure and Traditional Chinese translation.

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Professional Doctor Persona
- **Identity**: Dr. HoloWellness - experienced human wellness doctor
- **Expertise**: Sports medicine, general health, and preventive care
- **Tone**: Professional yet warm, concise, evidence-based

#### 2. Mandatory Response Structure
All AI responses must follow this exact 4-part format:
1. **Brief empathetic acknowledgment** (1 sentence)
2. **Professional assessment** based on symptoms (1-2 sentences)
3. **Two specific, actionable recommendations**
4. **One relevant follow-up question** to gather more information

#### 3. Two-Step Translation Pipeline
- **Step 1**: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B generates English medical response
- **Step 2**: llama3f1-medical translates to Traditional Chinese
- **Coverage**: Applied to both RAG and fallback modes

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Files Modified

##### backend/app.py
- Updated fallback mode system prompt with professional structure
- Added translation layer to fallback responses
- Ensured consistent 4-part format across all response paths

```python
# Professional system prompt in fallback mode
"You are Dr. HoloWellness, an experienced human wellness doctor with expertise in sports medicine, general health, and preventive care. You are speaking directly to your patient in a professional consultation. "

"RESPONSE STRUCTURE - Follow this format STRICTLY: "
"1. Brief empathetic acknowledgment (1 sentence) "
"2. Professional assessment based on symptoms (1-2 sentences) "
"3. Two specific, actionable recommendations "
"4. One relevant follow-up question to gather more information "
```

##### backend/rag_qwen.py
- Enhanced system prompt with detailed example format
- Implemented strict response structure enforcement
- Maintained document context integration

```python
system_prompt = f"""You are Dr. HoloWellness, an experienced human wellness doctor with expertise in sports medicine, general health, and preventive care. You are speaking directly to your patient in a professional consultation.

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
Patient: "I have shoulder pain when lifting my arm"
Dr. HoloWellness: "I understand how concerning shoulder pain can be, especially when it affects your daily activities. Based on your symptoms, this sounds like it could be rotator cuff irritation or impingement syndrome, which is common with overhead movements.

Here are my recommendations:
1. Apply ice for 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times daily to reduce inflammation
2. Temporarily avoid overhead activities and lifting to allow healing

To better assist you, can you tell me if the pain is worse at night or when you try to reach behind your back?"
```

#### 4. Memory Optimization
- **Single worker configuration**: Prevents memory multiplication in production
- **Selective feature disabling**: Enhanced RAG disabled in production to reduce memory usage
- **Graceful fallbacks**: System continues operation even with limited resources

#### 5. RAG System Enhancements
- **Fixed retrieved_context field**: Corrected field name mismatch for frontend display
- **Hybrid search**: Vector + BM25 search for better document retrieval
- **Context formatting**: Structured display of retrieved sources

### Response Flow
1. **User Query** → English query processing
2. **Document Retrieval** → RAG system searches medical documents
3. **English Generation** → DeepSeek model creates structured English response
4. **Translation** → llama3f1-medical converts to Traditional Chinese
5. **Frontend Display** → Shows translated response with optional source viewing

### Deployment Configuration

#### gunicorn.conf.py
```python
workers = 1  # Single worker to minimize memory usage
max_requests = 100  # Restart workers after 100 requests
preload_app = True  # Share memory between workers
```

#### Environment Variables
- `FLASK_ENV=production` - Enables production optimizations
- `ENABLE_ENHANCED_RAG=false` - Disables memory-heavy features
- `RAG_SYNC_ON_START=false` - Prevents startup memory spikes

### User Experience Features
- **Professional medical consultation tone**
- **Consistent follow-up questions** for patient engagement
- **Traditional Chinese responses** for user accessibility
- **Retrieved sources display** with expandable context
- **Thinking process visibility** for transparency
- **Message rating system** for feedback collection

### Quality Assurance
- **Strict structure enforcement**: Prevents inconsistent response formats
- **Translation consistency**: Maintains medical terminology accuracy
- **Memory optimization**: Ensures stable deployment on limited resources
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for all failure scenarios

### Future Considerations
- Monitor response quality and user engagement
- Evaluate translation accuracy for medical terms
- Consider expanding to other medical specialties
- Potential integration with electronic health records
